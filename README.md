# Quiz Management System (Java Swing + Database)

A GUI-based Quiz Management System developed using Java Swing and Database integration. 
This project allows users to attempt quizzes through an interactive interface, fetches 
questions from a database, and automatically evaluates scores.

# Project Overview

This application replaces traditional console-based quizzes with a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
built using Java Swing. Quiz questions are stored in a database, making the system dynamic, 
scalable, and easy to update without changing the source code.

# Features

  Interactive GUI using Java Swing
  Multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
  Questions loaded dynamically from database
  Automatic score calculation
  Next / Submit button navigation
  User-friendly design
  Easy to extend with more questions

# Technologies Used

  Java (JDK 8+)
  Java Swing (GUI)
  JDBC (Database Connectivity)
  MySQL / SQLite (any one can be used)

# Set Up Database

  Create database and table using SQL provided above
  Update database credentials in DBConnection.java

    String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/quiz_db";
    String user = "root";
    String password = "your_password";

# How to run this on console:-

    javac -cp ".;mysql-connector-j-9.4.0.jar" QuizSystem.java
    java -cp ".;mysql-connector-j-9.4.0.jar" QuizSystem
